This project is a **Carnival Block Management System** developed to manage and organize various carnival blocks, participants, schedules, and estimates. It was created as part of a college assignment, focusing on the management of carnival blocks in a Java-based system.

## Features

- **Block Registration**: Allows the creation and management of carnival blocks.
- **Participant Management**: Register and manage participants (foliões).
- **Schedule Conflict Detection**: Ensures no conflicting schedules for different blocks.
- **Public Estimate**: Calculates an estimated number of people attending a carnival block.
- **Recommendations**: Provides recommendations for managing the event more efficiently based on user input and data.

## Technologies Used

- Java 8
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- JavaFX (Optional for GUI if implemented)

## Project Structure

The project is organized into classes, each responsible for different functionalities. Below is an outline of the main components:

- **Bloco Class**: Represents a carnival block and its properties.
- **Participant Class**: Represents the participants (foliões) in a block.
- **Schedule Management**: Manages the block scheduling and conflicts.
- **Public Estimate**: Calculates the estimated attendance for each block.
